This document describes how to install PyDedupe.  If you have easy_install, 
installing should be as simple as::

 easy_install pydedupe

Installing PyDedupe from source
================================

_Python >= 2.5 is required. Test as follows::

 python --version

_setuptools is requires to install the software. Test as follows::

 sudo easy_install --help
 
First extract the PyDedupe sources, and install PyDedupe locally::

 python setup.py install --prefix=~/.local

Then run the test suite to check that it works::

 python -m dedupe.tests.__init__

Congratulations, PyDedupe is now installed.  Next read the TUTORIAL doctest
